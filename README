Manipulate LLVM assembly

This tool performs the following operations (among others)

      ids | prints the total number of instructions
     list | list instructions with their types and ids
     name | name each instruction by its id
    trace | instrument to save an instruction execution trace
      cut | cuts the numbered instruction
   insert | copies the second numbered instruction before the first
  replace | replace inst1 with inst2
     swap | swaps the two numbered instructions

Installation

  This tool is implemented as an LLVM compiler pass (see [1]).  It is
  built using the LLVM cmake machinery [2], and requires that LLVM was
  installed with cmake, but does *not* require access to the LLVM
  source tree.  Run the following to build, possible changing
  /usr/local/share/llvm/cmake to the appropriate path on your system.

    cmake -DLLVM_DIR=/usr/local/share/llvm/cmake .
    make

Examples

  First compile a source file to LLVM assembly.

    $ echo 'main(){ puts("hello"); puts("goodbye");}' \
        |clang -x c - -S -emit-llvm -o greet.ll

  See the behavior of the original.

    $ cat greet.ll|./llvm-mutate -l

    $ ./a.out
    hello
    goodbye

  Count the instruction ids in the original program.

    $ cat greet.ll|./llvm-mutate -I -o /dev/null
    3

  Compile a version which saves an instruction execution trace

    $ cat greet.ll|llvm-mutate -t -l
    $ ./a.out 
    hello
    goodbye
    $ cat llvm_mutate_trace
    1
    2
    3

  Cut the first instruction from this program, compile and run.

    $ cat greet.ll|./llvm-mutate -c 1 -l
    cut 1

    $ ./a.out
    goodbye

  Insert the second instruction before the first.

    $ cat greet.ll|./llvm-mutate -i 1,2 -l
    inserted 2 before 1

    $ ./a.out
    goodbye
    hello
    goodbye

  Swap the first two instructions.

    $ cat greet.ll|./llvm-mutate -s 1,2 -l
    swapped 1 with 2

    $ ./a.out
    goodbye
    hello

  We can also look at a slightly more complicated file which actually
  has some data dependencies between instructions.  Dependencies which
  the mutation tool will need to address.

    $ make arith.ll

    $ cat arith.ll|./llvm-mutate -l

    $ ./a.out
    25

  Here mutations will change the data dependencies between the
  instructions, and effect the value of `x` which is printed at the
  end.

    $ cat arith.ll|./llvm-mutate -c 4 -l
    found local replacement: 0x2ac0aa8
    cut 4

    $ ./a.out
    4

    $ cat arith.ll|./llvm-mutate -c 3 -l
    cut 3

    $ ./a.out
    9

    $ cat arith.ll|./llvm-mutate -c 6 -l
    found local replacement: 0x39aaaa8
    cut 6

    $ ./a.out
    10

  The compiler pass attempts to plug new instructions into the call
  graph near where they are inserted, satisfying their arguments with
  in-scope variables and plugging their output into the arguments of
  subsequent variables.

    $ cat arith.ll|./llvm-mutate -i 6,9 -l
    replacing argument: 0x2f6ce50
    found local replacement: 0x2f6cae8
    inserted 9 before 6

    $ ./a.out
    4

  When this isn't possible, a warning is printed and the insertion
  likely has no effect.

    $ cat arith.ll|./llvm-mutate -i 4,10 -l
    could find no use for result
    inserted 10 before 4

    $ ./a.out
    25

  Unless of course the inserted instruction acts through side effects.
  For example this copies the printf instruction into the middle of
  the function.

    $ cat arith.ll|./llvm-mutate -i 4,11 -l
    replacing argument: 0x1e34f88
    found local replacement: 0x1e34ae8
    inserted 11 before 4

    $ ./a.out
    2
    25

  See the output of `llvm-mutate --help` for more actions which may
  be performed on compiled llvm IR.  If multiple options are given to
  llvm-mutate they will be applied in series to the code.  So for
  example the following command line will,

    $ cat arith.ll|./llvm-mutate -I -g -G -c 3 -I -i 4,10 -I -G -l
    12
    cut 3
    11
    replacing argument: 0x1d7df08
    found local replacement: 0x1d7db80
    inserted 10 before 4
    12

    $ ./a.out 
    3
    9

  1. print a count of instruction ids,
  2. generate the program control flow graph
     (shown on screen if `dot` and `feh` are installed),
  3. generate the program call graph
  4. cut an instruction,
  5. print another id count,
  6. inserts an instruction,
  7. prints a third instruction id count,
  8. display the new call graph
  9. and finally link the resulting LLVM IR into an executable.
